This is an incomplete implementation of a 234 Tree in C. 

Supported operations:
    * insert search

Supported storage types:
    * int

It could also be thought of as a B-Tree with its minimum degree set to 2,
T=2. In fact by changing the value of T in the source code you can change
the tree's minimum degree.

I originally wrote this program because of a school assignment to write a
234 Tree in Java. I was taking a C class at the same time so I decided to
write a C version as well as the required Java version.
